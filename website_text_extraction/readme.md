## Overview
APIFEX website text extraction is an open public API that lets the user convert URLs into their contents as plaintext.  

API endpoint: https://websitetextextraction.apifex.com/api/v1/extract (can be used for GET and POST requests)  

## Online Interface

[Click here to visit API, then click 'Try it out'](https://websitetextextraction.apifex.com/#/API%20methods/extract_text_get_api_v1_extract_get)

## Example

`curl -X GET "https://websitetextextraction.apifex.com/api/v1/extract?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.cern%2Fnews%2Fnews%2Fphysics%2Fneutron-stars-show-their-cores" -H  "accept: application/json"`

... or via POST:

`curl -X POST "https://websitetextextraction.apifex.com/api/v1/extract" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"url\":\"https://home.cern/news/news/physics/neutron-stars-show-their-cores\"}"`

The website text extraction API will return the content of this site as plaintext (example only shows a part of the text):

```
{
    "website_content_length": 129113,
    "extracted_text_length": 7334,
    "language_code": "en",
    "language_name": "ENGLISH",
    "text": "The theoretical calculations involved describing the state of matter inside a neutron star from the crust all the way down to the centre. To do this, the researchers used so-called equations of state, which relate the pressure of a state of matter to the energy density â€“ the amount of energy packed into a system or region of space per unit volume. The team then plugged two pieces of information from astronomical data into these calculations: the observation that neutron stars can have masses equivalent to two Suns; and the possible values of a property called tidal deformability for a neutron star with a mass of about 1.4 times that of the Sun."
}
```

## Limits

The uncompressed (after gzip, brotli, etc...) content of the requested site must not be larger than 500 000 bytes. Larger requests will return an HTTP status code 413 - Request Entity Too Large.  
If the requested site cannot be loaded within 5000ms an HTTP status code 408 - Request Timeout will be returned.  
Each requested URL will be cached for 10 minutes.  
JavaScript is not rendered when extracting the text.
Per IP rate limits allow 1 request per second per unique IP address (plus a maximum burst of 5 requests).  
Requests that exceed the rate limits will return a HTTP status code 429 - Too Many Requests.  
URLs are limited to 1024 characters. Requests with URL fields larger than 1024 characters will return an HTTP status code 422 - Unprocessable Entity.  
Rate limits may be adapted without further notice.  
Endpoints can be accessed via HTTPS (recommended) or HTTP to reduce overhead from encryption.
